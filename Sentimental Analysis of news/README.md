# Motivation
   The stock prediction has been a popular topic for many years but most people approach this problem by analyzing the stock performance in the past to obtain insights about market returns in the future. This approach has been proven to have many shortcomings since company’s performance is not linear and their stock data alone won’t be comprehensive enough to predict their stock movements in the future.
   The objective of our research is taken into account emotional states of a company combine with many quarterly financial KPIs of companies to obtain a more comprehensive stock prediction model.  
   For more explaination of approach to this problem, read `Result Analysis.ipynb` and `NLP modeling.ipynb` which contain a majority of methodoly explaination.
